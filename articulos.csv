"Firefox 77新功能：开发工具改进和Web平台更新","全新Firefox稳定版现已推出。版本77为Web开发人员带来了诸多新功能。 本文只是归纳了一些亮点；如需了解详细信息，请参见以下资源： MDN上的Firefox 77开发人员须知 Firefox 77最终用户发行说明 开发人员工具改进 首先来看看版本77中最值得关注的开发人员工具改进和补充。若要进一步了解进行中的工作并提供反馈，请下载Firefox DevEdition来抢先体验。 JavaScript调试更快速、更精简 大型Web应用可能会给DevTools带来挑战，因为捆绑、实时重载和依赖项都需要得到快速、正确地处理。在版本77中，Firefox的调试器有了更多本领，让您能够专注于调试。 我们经过多个发行版本改进了调试性能，在寻找可动手的高影响力Bug错误方面即将达到终点。因此，为了能找到残留的瓶颈，我们积极与社区交流。我们收到了许多详细的报告，实现了诸多性能改进，不仅加快了暂停和分步执行，同时也降低了不同时间点上的内存占用。 行之有效的JavaScript和CSS源映射 源映射是这次扩展的组成部分，在性能增强方面功效显著。部分内联源映射在加载时间上提升了10倍。但更重要的是，我们加强了更多源映射配置的可靠性。我们解决了解析和映射的回退问题，而这要归功于大家提供的有关生成稍有差错的源映射的报告。总体而言，之前无法加载您的原始CSS和JavaScript/TypeScript/etc代码的项目如今应该可以正常运作了。 在选定堆栈帧内分步执行JavaScript 分步执行是调试的一个重要部分，但不够直观明了。在进入和退出函数以及在库和自有代码之间移动时，您可能很容易迷失方向并超出范围。 现在，调试器可以在分步执行时遵从当前选定的堆栈。当您进入某个函数调用后，或者在堆栈深处的某个库方法上暂停时，这特别有用。只需在调用堆栈中选择正确的函数，即可跳转到当前暂停的行并从那里继续分步执行。 请翻译：Alt文本：前往调用堆栈并在相应函数中继续分步执行 希望这能让代码分步执行变得更加直观明了，并降低您遗漏重要代码行的几率。 Network和Debugger的溢出设置 为了造就更简洁的工具栏，Network和Debugger沿用与Console相同的范例，将现有和新的复选框组合成一个全新的设置菜单。这不仅让您一手掌握“Disable JavaScript”等功能强大的选项，也给未来更强大的选项留出余地。 请翻译：Alt文本：Network和Debugger工具栏中的溢出设置菜单。 暂停属性读写 了解状态变化是个问题，通常通过控制台调试日志来调查。观察点(Watchpoint)是Firefox 72中引入的功能，可以在脚本读取或写入属性的过程中暂停执行。暂停之后，右键单击Scopes面板中的属性即可关联它们。 请翻译：Alt文本：右键单击Debugger的Scopes中的对象属性以在get/set上中断 感谢Janelle deMent的贡献，组合了get/set的新选项使观察点变得更易使用，任何脚本引用皆可触发暂停。 改进的Network数据预览 Network详情面板在每次发行时都有进步，如今已得到重新架构。旧界面中存在事件处理Bug错误，使选择和复制文本容易出错。我们不仅解决了这一点，也提升了大型数据输入的性能。 这是Network面板中重要界面清理工作的一部分，我们已就此通过@FirefoxDevTools Twitter和Mozilla的Matrix社区向社区发出了问卷调查。欢迎您分享您的见解。您也可下载Firefox DevEdition，抢先体验Network面板边栏的更多新设计。 Web平台更新 Firefox 77支持多项新的Web平台功能。 String#replaceAll Firefox 67引入了String#matchAll，这是一种更便于迭代regex结果匹配项的方式。在Firefox 77中，我们让便捷程度更进一步：通过String#replaceAll来帮助替换字符串的所有实例；这或许是您长久以来梦寐以求的运算（感谢StackOverflow做出的巨大贡献！）。 在过去，若要将所有cats替换成dogs，必须要使用全局正则表达式 .replace(/cats/g, 'dogs'); 或者，也可使用split和join： .split('cats').join('dogs'); 现在，因为有了String#replaceAll，这变得更加易读了： .replaceAll('cats', 'dogs'); IndexedDB光标请求 Firefox 77将IDBCursor所源自的请求作为光标上的属性来公开。这是一种精妙的改进，使得“升级”数据库功能的wrapper函数的编写变得更加轻松。在过去，如果要对光标进行这种升级，必须要传递光标对象和它所源自的请求对象，因为前者依赖于后者。有了这一改进，现在只需要传递光标对象，因为请求已在光标上可用。 Firefox 77中的扩展：请求变少，权限更多 从Firefox […]","https://hacks.mozilla.org/2020/06/firefox-77/","June 8, 2020","https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e512071de0dba8034350e20f87e50e66?s=72&d=mm&r=g","Florian Scholz"

"Firefox 75: 四月新氣象","即使在這段隔離的時期，我們的工程團隊也已經調整好步調，保持專注並努力工作，並獻上令人興奮的新版Firefox。在開發人員工具方面，你可以在網頁主控台中使用即時求值、WebSockets事件斷點以及許多其他功能。在網頁平台方面，新增的功能包括HTML延遲載入圖片、CSS min()，max()和clamp()函數、公開靜態類別屬性以及支援網頁動畫API附加功能等。 與往常一樣，請點擊下方閱讀重點，或在下文瀏覽所有新增功能的完整列表： Firefox 75 開發人員專區 Firefox 75網頁相容性 Firefox 75終端用戶專區 新增開發人員工具 讓我們先來看看Firefox 75中最有趣的開發人員新工具。 即時測試控制台表達式 在控制台中測試表達式是了解應用程序狀態、查詢DOM或試用JavaScript API非常便捷的方法。現在，利用Firefox控制台的多行模式使編寫較長的代碼更為容易，在使用上更為友善，且更貼近整合開發環境。 新的即時測試可以在輸入時預覽當前表達式的結果，有點類似Quokka.js編輯器。只要在Web控制台中鍵入的表達式沒有副作用，在輸入時便可以直接預覽結果。 為了使預覽盡可能無縫，需要花費很大的功夫。以當前的成果來說，DOM節點的元素表現出色，而代碼內自動完成功能也會根據結果類型推薦方法和屬性。此外，更可以預覽錯誤以快速地修復表達式。 更佳的檢查和測量方法 現在可以調整測量面積大小 使用DevTools中的選用面積測量工具可以在頁面上快速繪製矩形以測量特定區域的高度、寬度和對角線長度。在「可用的工具箱按鈕」的設置中可以啟用該工具。感謝Sebastian Zartner [:sebo]，這些矩形現在具有調整大小的句柄，因此可以精準地進行調整。 利用Xpath查詢DOM元素 Xpath查詢通常用於自動化工具中，以告知軟件要定位與互動的元素。再次感謝Sebo，現在可以利用HTML的頁面檢測器搜索以XPath來查詢DOM元素。這使得在網站上實際測試表達式和修改變得更加容易。 WebSockets的事件斷點 在每個最新的DevTools版本中，WebSocket檢查功能都持續進步。這次，天資聰穎的Chujun Lu在除錯方面做出了很大的貢獻。 在執行WebSocket事件處理程序時，你可以利用除錯器中新的事件監聽器斷點（Event Listener Breakpoints）暫停或是記錄。選擇紀錄選項後，事件數據和已執行的處理程序會被記錄下來，但是不會暫停執行。 在WebSocket Inspector中，由於Outvi V長期的貢獻，消息過濾器現在可以支援一般的表達式。 網路新增功能 Firefox 75在網絡介面的質量和性能方面有大幅的進步。這個版本的渲染效能立下了新的里程碑，可以快速渲染同時發動的請求，又不增加CPU的負擔。 在介面方面，貢獻者Florens Verschelde提出了在列之間添加邊框以提升可讀性的建議和設計。這個設計使DevTools整體的外觀更加一致。貢獻者Vitalii在改善狀態之間的對比度後，篩選按鈕也變得更清晰。 阻斷請求面板可協助測試匹配請求失敗時網站的彈性。現在，它允許包含“ *”的萬用字源。感謝Duncan Dean的貢獻。 開發者版本中搶先體驗DevTools功能 開發者版本是Firefox的預發布渠道，可以提早體驗編程和平台功能。默認情況中，瀏覽器的設定提供開發人員了更多功能。我們希望盡快在開發者版本中加入新功能，並收集不同的反饋，包括以下重點。 除錯器和控制台的異步堆棧跟踪追蹤 現代的JavaScript編碼很大程度上取決於在其他異步作業（例如：event、promise和timeout）之上堆疊async/await。在與JavaScript引擎整合優化之後，現在異步作業得以提供更完整的服務。 利用除錯器中的異步堆棧可以逐步了解所執行的event、timeout和基於promise的函數調用。在控制台中，透過異步堆棧使查找錯誤的根本原因變得更加容易。 網頁平台更新 讓我們看看Firefox 75網頁平台方面的更新。 HTML延遲載入圖片 延遲加載是用來提升性能常用的一個策略。透過將資源標記為非阻塞（非關鍵）資源，並在需要時才加載，而不是立即加載所有資源。Web App中延遲加載的最常見的資源之一為圖片。 為了讓延遲載入圖片時在使用上更為簡便，我們提供支援HTML <img>元素的load屬性。只要將之設定為lazy，就可以使瀏覽器延遲載入尚未出現在畫面中的圖片，直到使用者快瀏覽到圖片時才加以載入。另一個屬性則是eager，也就是一般預設的屬性。 […]","https://hacks.mozilla.org/2020/04/firefox-75/","April 14, 2020","https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/deeea0ba82390bd5acc539703c4b0cfb?s=72&d=mm&r=g","Chris Mills"
"Firefox 75：四月的远大志向","即使在隔离时期，我们的工程团队也努力适应、保持专注并努力工作，为您带来又一个令人兴奋的新版Firefox。在开发人员工具方面，您会找到控制台中的即时评估、WebSockets的事件断点，以及其他许多功能。在网络平台方面，新增的功能包括图像的HTML延迟加载、CSS min()、max()和clamp()函数、公共静态类字段以及对Web动画API支持的补充。 请照例阅读重点内容或从以下文章中找到所有新增内容的完整列表： Firefox 75开发人员必读 Firefox 75的网站兼容性 Firefox 75最终用户发行说明 开发人员工具补充 我们首先来看看75最有趣的开发人员工具。 控制台表达式即时评估 控制台中的评估表达式是探索应用程序状态、查询DOM或试用JavaScript API的快速方法。现在，Firefox的多行控制台模式已经变得更友好、更像IDE，可用于更轻松地为更长的代码制作原型。 新的即时评估会在您键入时显示当前表达式的结果预览，类似于Quokka.js 这样的编辑器。只要在Web控制台中键入的表达式没有副作用，就会在您键入时显示结果预览。 为了使预览尽可能无缝，进行了大量改进。结果中DOM节点的元素为突出显示。代码内自动填写功能根据结果类型推荐方法和属性。另外，您可以预览错误以更快地修复表达式。 更好地检查和测量 面积测量现可调整大小 使用DevTools中的可选面积测量工具，您可以在页面上快速绘制矩形以测量特定区域的高度、宽度和对角线长度。您可以在“可用工具箱按钮”下的设置中启用该工具。感谢Sebastian Zartner [:sebo]，这些矩形现在有调整大小的句柄，方便您精确地调整。 使用XPath查找DOM元素 XPath查询通常用于自动化工具中，以告知软件要查找并与之交互的元素。您现在可以在Inspector的HTML搜索中将XPath用于DOM元素，这也是归功于sebo。这使得在实际站点上测试表达式和微调查询变得更加容易。 WebSocket的事件断点 最近的每个DevTools版本都对WebSocket检查功能进行了改进。这次，由于才华横溢的Chujun Lu的贡献，调试方面得到了一个不错的补充。 现在，您可以在执行WebSocket事件处理程序时选择暂停或记录。使用调试器中新添加的事件监听器断点。选择“记录”选项时，将记录事件数据和执行的处理程序，但执行不会暂停。 WebSocket Inspector的新消息还包括：由于Outvi V的长期贡献，消息过滤器现支持正则表达式。 网络添加 Firefox 75的“网络”面板中进行了大量质量和性能方面的工作。此版本中在不增加CPU负担的情况下大幅提升了发出快速请求的速度。 在界面方面，贡献者Florens Verschelde推进了在列之间添加边框以提高可读性的建议和设计。注意设计变得与DevTools的整体外观更加一致了。感谢贡献者Vitalii，过滤器按钮也更加清晰易读，状态之间的对比度得到了改善。 “请求阻止”面板可帮助您测试匹配请求失败时站点的恢复能力。现在，它允许带有“*”的通配符模式。感谢Duncan Dean所做的贡献。 Developer Edition（开发人员版）中DevTools功能抢先体验 Developer Edition是Firefox的预发布渠道，可以抢先体验各种工具和平台功能。该版本的默认设置中还为开发人员开启了更多的功能。我们喜欢将新功能快速引入到Developer Edition，以便收集反馈信息，重点包括以下内容。 调试器 & 控制台异步堆栈跟踪 现代JavaScript代码在很大程度上取决于在其他异步操作（如事件、承诺以及超时）之上堆叠async/await。由于与JavaScript引擎集成得好，现已可以捕捉到异步执行过程，以提供更完整的画面。 调试器中的异步调用堆栈使您可以单步调试事件、超时以及依照时间执行的基于承诺的函数调用。控制台的异步堆栈使查找错误的根本原因变得更为容易。 Web平台更新 我们来探讨一下Firefox 75在网络平台更新方面提供的功能。 图像的HTML延迟加载 延迟加载是通过将资源标识为非阻塞（非关键）资源、以仅在需要时加载而不是立即加载来提高性能的常见策略。图像是要在网络应用中延迟加载的最常见资产之一。 为了简化图像延迟加载，我们在HTML <img>元素上引入了对加载属性的支持。将值设置为lazy会指示浏览器推迟加载屏幕外的图像，直到用户滚动到附近为止。唯一可能的其他值为eager，如您所想，这是默认值。 […]","https://hacks.mozilla.org/2020/04/firefox-75/","April 14, 2020","https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/deeea0ba82390bd5acc539703c4b0cfb?s=72&d=mm&r=g","Chris Mills"

"A rule-based framework to create dynamic themes","One issue with dynamic theming API compared to traditional CSS theming is that it requires familiarity with JavaScript and WebExtension APIs to make a basic dynamic theme. To address this problem, I have experimented with a simple system that enables dynamic theming using simple theming “rules”. A “rule” consists of a JavaScript condition string paired with a theme name. The boilerplate I've built takes care of the heavy-lifting needed by dynamic themes in order to set up WebExtension listeners, hooking with other APIs — to let you focus on the dynamic theming part.","https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/01/a-rule-based-framework-to-create-dynamic-themes/","January 29, 2018","https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a473c568e6e2eaa6d7048087a95a44af?s=72&d=mm&r=g","Tim Nguyen"

"Making WebAssembly even faster: Firefox’s new streaming and tiering compiler","People call WebAssembly a game changer because it makes it possible to run code on the web faster. Some speedups are already present, and some are yet to come. With streaming compilation, the browser compiles the code while the code is still being downloaded. Up until now, this was just a potential future speedup. But with the release of Firefox 58 next week, it becomes a reality. Firefox 58 also includes a new 2-tiered compiler. The new baseline compiler compiles code 10–15 times faster than the optimizing compiler. Combined, these two changes mean we compile code faster than it comes in from the network.","https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/01/making-webassembly-even-faster-firefoxs-new-streaming-and-tiering-compiler/","January 17, 2018","https://hacks.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/linclark_headshot-72x72.jpeg","Lin Clark"

Out of all […]","https://hacks.mozilla.org/2009/06/dom-selectors-api/","June 13, 2009","https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b3e04a46e85ad3e165d66f5d927eb609?s=72&d=mm&r=g","John Resig"

"stylish text with text-shadow","This post is from Frederic Wenzel, who works on Mozilla’s Web Development team.
