titulo: Improved Process Isolation in Firefox 100
resumen: Firefox uses a multi-process model for additional security and stability while browsing: Web Content (such as HTML/CSS and Javascript) is rendered in separate processes that are isolated from the rest of the operating system and managed by a privileged parent process. This way, the amount of control gained by an attacker that exploits a bug in a content process is limited. In this article, we would like to dive a bit further into the latest major milestone we have reached: Win32k Lockdown, which greatly reduces the capabilities of the content process when running on Windows.

titulo: Announcing Interop 2022
resumen: Writing high quality standards is a necessary first step to an interoperable web platform, but ensuring that browsers are consistent in their behavior requires an ongoing process. Browsers must work to ensure that they have a shared understanding of web standards, and that their implementation matches that understanding. Interop 2022 is a cross-browser initiative to find and address the most important interoperability pain points on the web platform. The end result is a public metric that will assess progress toward fixing these interoperability issues.

titulo: Implementing form filling and accessibility in the Firefox PDF viewer
resumen: Last year, during lockdown, many discovered the importance of PDF forms when having to deal remotely with administrations and large organizations like banks. Firefox supported displaying PDF forms, but it didn’t support filling them: users had to print them, fill them by hand, and scan them back to digital form. We decided it was time to reinvest in the PDF viewer (PDF.js) and support filling PDF forms within Firefox to make our users' lives easier.

resumen: Last month we removed a bunch of content from MDN. MDN is 16 years old (and yes it can drink in some countries), all that time ago it was a great place for all of Mozilla to document all of their things. As MDN evolved and the web reference became our core content, other areas became less relevant to the overall site. We have ~11k active pages on MDN, so keeping them up to date is a big task and we feel our focus should be there.

Also this release we see a few nice JavaScript additions, including private fields and methods for classes, and the at() method for Array, String and TypedArray global objects. This blog post just provides a set of highlights.

titulo: Implementing Private Fields for JavaScript
resumen: When implementing a language feature for JavaScript, an implementer must make decisions about how the language in the specification maps to the implementation. Private fields is an example of where the specification language and implementation reality diverge, at least in SpiderMonkey– the JavaScript engine which powers Firefox. To understand more, I’ll explain what private fields are, a couple of models for thinking about them, and explain why our implementation diverges from the specification language.

titulo: How MDN’s site-search works
resumen: Periodically, the whole of MDN is built, by our Node code , in a GitHub Action. A Python script bulk-publishes this to Elasticsearch. Our Django server queries the same Elasticsearch via /api/v1/search. The site-search page is a static single-page app that sends XHR requests to the /api/v1/search endpoint. Search results' sort-order is determined by match and "popularity".

titulo: Here’s what’s happening with the Firefox Nightly logo
resumen: The internet was set on fire (pun intended) this week, by what I'm calling 'fox gate', and chances are you might have seen a meme or two about the Firefox logo. Many people were pulling up for a battle royale because they thought we had scrubbed fox imagery from our browser. We can confirm, that this is definitely not happening.

titulo: Browser fuzzing at Mozilla
resumen: Mozilla has been fuzzing Firefox and its underlying components for a while. It has proven itself to be one of the most efficient ways to identify quality and security issues. In general, we apply fuzzing on different levels: there is fuzzing the browser as a whole but a significant amount of time is also spent on fuzzing isolated code (e.g. with libFuzzer) or even whole components such as the JS engine using separate shells with various fuzzers. For the purpose of this blog post, we will talk specifically about browser fuzzing only, and go into detail on the pipeline we’ve developed.

titulo: Analyzing Bugzilla Testcases with Bugmon
resumen: As a member of Mozilla’s fuzzing team, our job is not only to find bugs, but to do what we can to help get those bugs fixed as quickly as possible. To further reduce the delay in getting these bugs fixed, we wanted to automate as much of this process as possible.  This effort resulted in the development of Bugmon; a tool that automates these basic triage tasks for Firefox and SpiderMonkey bugs directly in Bugzilla.

titulo: Improving Cross-Browser Testing, Part 2: New Automation Features in Firefox Nightly
resumen: It’s clear that WebDriver needs to grow to meet the capabilities of DevTools-based automation. However, that process will take time, and we want more developers to be able to run their automated tests in Firefox today. To that end, we have shipped an experimental implementation of parts of CDP in Firefox Nightly, specifically targeting the use cases of end-to-end testing using Google’s Puppeteer, and the CDP-based features of Selenium 4.

resumen: At Mozilla, we want the web to be capable of running high-performance applications so that users and content authors can choose the safety, agency, and openness of the web platform. Shared-memory multi-threading is an essential low-level building block for high-performance applications. However, keeping users safe is paramount, which is why shared memory and high-resolution timers were effectively disabled at the start of 2018, in light of Spectre. Until now...

titulo: Testing Firefox more efficiently with machine learning
resumen: A browser is an enormously complex piece of software, and it's always in development. About a year ago, we asked ourselves: how could we do better? Our CI relied heavily on human intervention. What if we could instead correlate patches to tests using historical regression data? Could we use a machine learning algorithm to figure out the optimal set of tests to run? We hypothesized that we could run fewer tests to save money, get results faster, and reduce the cognitive burden on developers.

titulo: Firefox 77新功能：开发工具改进和Web平台更新
resumen: 全新Firefox稳定版现已推出。版本77为Web开发人员带来了诸多新功能。 本文只是归纳了一些亮点；如需了解详细信息，请参见以下资源： MDN上的Firefox 77开发人员须知 Firefox 77最终用户发行说明 开发人员工具改进 首先来看看版本77中最值得关注的开发人员工具改进和补充。若要进一步了解进行中的工作并提供反馈，请下载Firefox DevEdition来抢先体验。 JavaScript调试更快速、更精简 大型Web应用可能会给DevTools带来挑战，因为捆绑、实时重载和依赖项都需要得到快速、正确地处理。在版本77中，Firefox的调试器有了更多本领，让您能够专注于调试。 我们经过多个发行版本改进了调试性能，在寻找可动手的高影响力Bug错误方面即将达到终点。因此，为了能找到残留的瓶颈，我们积极与社区交流。我们收到了许多详细的报告，实现了诸多性能改进，不仅加快了暂停和分步执行，同时也降低了不同时间点上的内存占用。 行之有效的JavaScript和CSS源映射 源映射是这次扩展的组成部分，在性能增强方面功效显著。部分内联源映射在加载时间上提升了10倍。但更重要的是，我们加强了更多源映射配置的可靠性。我们解决了解析和映射的回退问题，而这要归功于大家提供的有关生成稍有差错的源映射的报告。总体而言，之前无法加载您的原始CSS和JavaScript/TypeScript/etc代码的项目如今应该可以正常运作了。 在选定堆栈帧内分步执行JavaScript 分步执行是调试的一个重要部分，但不够直观明了。在进入和退出函数以及在库和自有代码之间移动时，您可能很容易迷失方向并超出范围。 现在，调试器可以在分步执行时遵从当前选定的堆栈。当您进入某个函数调用后，或者在堆栈深处的某个库方法上暂停时，这特别有用。只需在调用堆栈中选择正确的函数，即可跳转到当前暂停的行并从那里继续分步执行。 请翻译：Alt文本：前往调用堆栈并在相应函数中继续分步执行 希望这能让代码分步执行变得更加直观明了，并降低您遗漏重要代码行的几率。 Network和Debugger的溢出设置 为了造就更简洁的工具栏，Network和Debugger沿用与Console相同的范例，将现有和新的复选框组合成一个全新的设置菜单。这不仅让您一手掌握“Disable JavaScript”等功能强大的选项，也给未来更强大的选项留出余地。 请翻译：Alt文本：Network和Debugger工具栏中的溢出设置菜单。 暂停属性读写 了解状态变化是个问题，通常通过控制台调试日志来调查。观察点(Watchpoint)是Firefox 72中引入的功能，可以在脚本读取或写入属性的过程中暂停执行。暂停之后，右键单击Scopes面板中的属性即可关联它们。 请翻译：Alt文本：右键单击Debugger的Scopes中的对象属性以在get/set上中断 感谢Janelle deMent的贡献，组合了get/set的新选项使观察点变得更易使用，任何脚本引用皆可触发暂停。 改进的Network数据预览 Network详情面板在每次发行时都有进步，如今已得到重新架构。旧界面中存在事件处理Bug错误，使选择和复制文本容易出错。我们不仅解决了这一点，也提升了大型数据输入的性能。 这是Network面板中重要界面清理工作的一部分，我们已就此通过@FirefoxDevTools Twitter和Mozilla的Matrix社区向社区发出了问卷调查。欢迎您分享您的见解。您也可下载Firefox DevEdition，抢先体验Network面板边栏的更多新设计。 Web平台更新 Firefox 77支持多项新的Web平台功能。 String#replaceAll Firefox 67引入了String#matchAll，这是一种更便于迭代regex结果匹配项的方式。在Firefox 77中，我们让便捷程度更进一步：通过String#replaceAll来帮助替换字符串的所有实例；这或许是您长久以来梦寐以求的运算（感谢StackOverflow做出的巨大贡献！）。 在过去，若要将所有cats替换成dogs，必须要使用全局正则表达式 .replace(/cats/g, 'dogs'); 或者，也可使用split和join： .split('cats').join('dogs'); 现在，因为有了String#replaceAll，这变得更加易读了： .replaceAll('cats', 'dogs'); IndexedDB光标请求 Firefox 77将IDBCursor所源自的请求作为光标上的属性来公开。这是一种精妙的改进，使得“升级”数据库功能的wrapper函数的编写变得更加轻松。在过去，如果要对光标进行这种升级，必须要传递光标对象和它所源自的请求对象，因为前者依赖于后者。有了这一改进，现在只需要传递光标对象，因为请求已在光标上可用。 Firefox 77中的扩展：请求变少，权限更多 从Firefox […]

titulo: Firefox 75: 四月新氣象
resumen: 即使在這段隔離的時期，我們的工程團隊也已經調整好步調，保持專注並努力工作，並獻上令人興奮的新版Firefox。在開發人員工具方面，你可以在網頁主控台中使用即時求值、WebSockets事件斷點以及許多其他功能。在網頁平台方面，新增的功能包括HTML延遲載入圖片、CSS min()，max()和clamp()函數、公開靜態類別屬性以及支援網頁動畫API附加功能等。 與往常一樣，請點擊下方閱讀重點，或在下文瀏覽所有新增功能的完整列表： Firefox 75 開發人員專區 Firefox 75網頁相容性 Firefox 75終端用戶專區 新增開發人員工具 讓我們先來看看Firefox 75中最有趣的開發人員新工具。 即時測試控制台表達式 在控制台中測試表達式是了解應用程序狀態、查詢DOM或試用JavaScript API非常便捷的方法。現在，利用Firefox控制台的多行模式使編寫較長的代碼更為容易，在使用上更為友善，且更貼近整合開發環境。 新的即時測試可以在輸入時預覽當前表達式的結果，有點類似Quokka.js編輯器。只要在Web控制台中鍵入的表達式沒有副作用，在輸入時便可以直接預覽結果。 為了使預覽盡可能無縫，需要花費很大的功夫。以當前的成果來說，DOM節點的元素表現出色，而代碼內自動完成功能也會根據結果類型推薦方法和屬性。此外，更可以預覽錯誤以快速地修復表達式。 更佳的檢查和測量方法 現在可以調整測量面積大小 使用DevTools中的選用面積測量工具可以在頁面上快速繪製矩形以測量特定區域的高度、寬度和對角線長度。在「可用的工具箱按鈕」的設置中可以啟用該工具。感謝Sebastian Zartner [:sebo]，這些矩形現在具有調整大小的句柄，因此可以精準地進行調整。 利用Xpath查詢DOM元素 Xpath查詢通常用於自動化工具中，以告知軟件要定位與互動的元素。再次感謝Sebo，現在可以利用HTML的頁面檢測器搜索以XPath來查詢DOM元素。這使得在網站上實際測試表達式和修改變得更加容易。 WebSockets的事件斷點 在每個最新的DevTools版本中，WebSocket檢查功能都持續進步。這次，天資聰穎的Chujun Lu在除錯方面做出了很大的貢獻。 在執行WebSocket事件處理程序時，你可以利用除錯器中新的事件監聽器斷點（Event Listener Breakpoints）暫停或是記錄。選擇紀錄選項後，事件數據和已執行的處理程序會被記錄下來，但是不會暫停執行。 在WebSocket Inspector中，由於Outvi V長期的貢獻，消息過濾器現在可以支援一般的表達式。 網路新增功能 Firefox 75在網絡介面的質量和性能方面有大幅的進步。這個版本的渲染效能立下了新的里程碑，可以快速渲染同時發動的請求，又不增加CPU的負擔。 在介面方面，貢獻者Florens Verschelde提出了在列之間添加邊框以提升可讀性的建議和設計。這個設計使DevTools整體的外觀更加一致。貢獻者Vitalii在改善狀態之間的對比度後，篩選按鈕也變得更清晰。 阻斷請求面板可協助測試匹配請求失敗時網站的彈性。現在，它允許包含“ *”的萬用字源。感謝Duncan Dean的貢獻。 開發者版本中搶先體驗DevTools功能 開發者版本是Firefox的預發布渠道，可以提早體驗編程和平台功能。默認情況中，瀏覽器的設定提供開發人員了更多功能。我們希望盡快在開發者版本中加入新功能，並收集不同的反饋，包括以下重點。 除錯器和控制台的異步堆棧跟踪追蹤 現代的JavaScript編碼很大程度上取決於在其他異步作業（例如：event、promise和timeout）之上堆疊async/await。在與JavaScript引擎整合優化之後，現在異步作業得以提供更完整的服務。 利用除錯器中的異步堆棧可以逐步了解所執行的event、timeout和基於promise的函數調用。在控制台中，透過異步堆棧使查找錯誤的根本原因變得更加容易。 網頁平台更新 讓我們看看Firefox 75網頁平台方面的更新。 HTML延遲載入圖片 延遲加載是用來提升性能常用的一個策略。透過將資源標記為非阻塞（非關鍵）資源，並在需要時才加載，而不是立即加載所有資源。Web App中延遲加載的最常見的資源之一為圖片。 為了讓延遲載入圖片時在使用上更為簡便，我們提供支援HTML <img>元素的load屬性。只要將之設定為lazy，就可以使瀏覽器延遲載入尚未出現在畫面中的圖片，直到使用者快瀏覽到圖片時才加以載入。另一個屬性則是eager，也就是一般預設的屬性。 […]

titulo: Firefox 75：四月的远大志向
resumen: 即使在隔离时期，我们的工程团队也努力适应、保持专注并努力工作，为您带来又一个令人兴奋的新版Firefox。在开发人员工具方面，您会找到控制台中的即时评估、WebSockets的事件断点，以及其他许多功能。在网络平台方面，新增的功能包括图像的HTML延迟加载、CSS min()、max()和clamp()函数、公共静态类字段以及对Web动画API支持的补充。 请照例阅读重点内容或从以下文章中找到所有新增内容的完整列表： Firefox 75开发人员必读 Firefox 75的网站兼容性 Firefox 75最终用户发行说明 开发人员工具补充 我们首先来看看75最有趣的开发人员工具。 控制台表达式即时评估 控制台中的评估表达式是探索应用程序状态、查询DOM或试用JavaScript API的快速方法。现在，Firefox的多行控制台模式已经变得更友好、更像IDE，可用于更轻松地为更长的代码制作原型。 新的即时评估会在您键入时显示当前表达式的结果预览，类似于Quokka.js 这样的编辑器。只要在Web控制台中键入的表达式没有副作用，就会在您键入时显示结果预览。 为了使预览尽可能无缝，进行了大量改进。结果中DOM节点的元素为突出显示。代码内自动填写功能根据结果类型推荐方法和属性。另外，您可以预览错误以更快地修复表达式。 更好地检查和测量 面积测量现可调整大小 使用DevTools中的可选面积测量工具，您可以在页面上快速绘制矩形以测量特定区域的高度、宽度和对角线长度。您可以在“可用工具箱按钮”下的设置中启用该工具。感谢Sebastian Zartner [:sebo]，这些矩形现在有调整大小的句柄，方便您精确地调整。 使用XPath查找DOM元素 XPath查询通常用于自动化工具中，以告知软件要查找并与之交互的元素。您现在可以在Inspector的HTML搜索中将XPath用于DOM元素，这也是归功于sebo。这使得在实际站点上测试表达式和微调查询变得更加容易。 WebSocket的事件断点 最近的每个DevTools版本都对WebSocket检查功能进行了改进。这次，由于才华横溢的Chujun Lu的贡献，调试方面得到了一个不错的补充。 现在，您可以在执行WebSocket事件处理程序时选择暂停或记录。使用调试器中新添加的事件监听器断点。选择“记录”选项时，将记录事件数据和执行的处理程序，但执行不会暂停。 WebSocket Inspector的新消息还包括：由于Outvi V的长期贡献，消息过滤器现支持正则表达式。 网络添加 Firefox 75的“网络”面板中进行了大量质量和性能方面的工作。此版本中在不增加CPU负担的情况下大幅提升了发出快速请求的速度。 在界面方面，贡献者Florens Verschelde推进了在列之间添加边框以提高可读性的建议和设计。注意设计变得与DevTools的整体外观更加一致了。感谢贡献者Vitalii，过滤器按钮也更加清晰易读，状态之间的对比度得到了改善。 “请求阻止”面板可帮助您测试匹配请求失败时站点的恢复能力。现在，它允许带有“*”的通配符模式。感谢Duncan Dean所做的贡献。 Developer Edition（开发人员版）中DevTools功能抢先体验 Developer Edition是Firefox的预发布渠道，可以抢先体验各种工具和平台功能。该版本的默认设置中还为开发人员开启了更多的功能。我们喜欢将新功能快速引入到Developer Edition，以便收集反馈信息，重点包括以下内容。 调试器 & 控制台异步堆栈跟踪 现代JavaScript代码在很大程度上取决于在其他异步操作（如事件、承诺以及超时）之上堆叠async/await。由于与JavaScript引擎集成得好，现已可以捕捉到异步执行过程，以提供更完整的画面。 调试器中的异步调用堆栈使您可以单步调试事件、超时以及依照时间执行的基于承诺的函数调用。控制台的异步堆栈使查找错误的根本原因变得更为容易。 Web平台更新 我们来探讨一下Firefox 75在网络平台更新方面提供的功能。 图像的HTML延迟加载 延迟加载是通过将资源标识为非阻塞（非关键）资源、以仅在需要时加载而不是立即加载来提高性能的常见策略。图像是要在网络应用中延迟加载的最常见资产之一。 为了简化图像延迟加载，我们在HTML <img>元素上引入了对加载属性的支持。将值设置为lazy会指示浏览器推迟加载屏幕外的图像，直到用户滚动到附近为止。唯一可能的其他值为eager，如您所想，这是默认值。 […]

titulo: Firefox 74，為安全賦予更多價值
resumen: 目前Firefox 74已經發布了。這次我們提供最重要的新功能是安全性的提升：特徵策略（Feature Policy），Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy標頭和移除TLS 1.0 / 1.1支援。我們還新增一些新的CSS文本屬性功能，JS鏈接運算符還有其他2D canvas文本度量標準功能，以及大量DevTools增強功能和錯誤修復功能。 本文同樣包含一些重點，你也可以在以下文章中閱讀新增功能的完整列表： Firefox 74開發人員專區 Firefox 74網頁相容性 Firefox 74終端用戶專區 提升安全性 讓我們看看74版本中安全性的改良。 特徵策略（Feature Policy） 我們終於在默認模式中啟用Feature Policy。你現在可以使用<iframe> allow屬性還有Feature-Policy HTTP標頭設定頂級文檔和iframe功能權限。語法範例如下： <iframe src="https://example.com" allow="fullscreen"></iframe> Feature-Policy: microphone 'none'; geolocation 'none' CORP 我們也啟用支援Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy (CORP)標頭，允許網站和應用程序因安全考量選擇拒絕針對某些跨域請求。例如：<script>和<img>元素。這也可以幫助減少潛在的旁路攻擊（例如Spectre和Meltdown）以及跨網站指令碼包含攻擊。 可用的屬性有same-origin和same-site。same-origin僅允許擁有相同scheme，host和port的請求讀取相關資源。這和網絡的默認同源協定相比，提供更高級的保護。same-site僅允許共享同一網站的請求。 可以將標頭依照以下範例運用CORP，例如： Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: same-site 移除TLS 1.0 / 1.1 最後，Firefox 74為了提升整體Web平台的安全性，取消支援TLS 1.0 / 1.1。這對於推動TLS生態系統的發展很重要，同時也可以消除TLS 1.0 / 1.1導致的許多漏洞。這項功能沒有像我們希望的那麼有效，它們需要退場了。 2018年10月在Mozilla，Google，Microsoft和Apple的共同倡議下，首次宣布這項變更。2020年3月，我們現在都兌現了我們的諾言（蘋果公司除外，蘋果公司稍後將進行變更）。 結論是你要確保你的Web服務器支持TLS 1.2或1.3。請閱讀移除TLS 1.0 and 1.1更新了解如何測試和更新TLS […]

resumen: Firefox 74已于今日发布。新版本最重要的新增功能体现在安全性方面的增强：特征策略（feature policy）、Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy标头及取消了对TLS 1.0 / 1.1的支持。我们还提供了一些新的CSS文本属性功能、可选JS链接运算符和其他2D画布文本测量功能，以及海量DevTools增强功能和错误修复功能。请照例阅读重点内容或从以下文章中找到所有新增内容的完整列表： Firefox 74开发人员必读 Firefox 74网站兼容性 Firefox 74最终用户发行说明 安全性增强 让我们了解一下74版本在安全性上的增强。 特征策略（Feature Policy） 最终版中Feature Policy（功能策略）默认开启。您现在可以使用<iframe> allow属性和Feature-PolicyHTTP标头为顶级文档和iframe设置功能权限。语法示例如下： <iframe src="https://example.com" allow="fullscreen"></iframe> Feature-Policy: microphone 'none'; geolocation 'none' CORP 我们还提供对Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy（CORP）标头的支持，允许站点和应用程序选择拒绝某些跨域请求（例如来自<script>和<img>元素的请求）。这有助于减少潜在的旁路攻击（例如Spectre和Meltdown）以及跨站点脚本包含攻击。 选项包括same-origin和same-site。same-origin仅允许同一方案、主机和端口的请求读取相关资源。除网络默认的同源策略外，它还提供了更多级别的保护。same-site仅允许来自同一站点的请求。 若要使用CORP，则必须将标头设置为下列值之一，例如： Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: same-site 移除TLS 1.0 / 1.1 最后还有一点（但并非不重要），Firefox 74取消了对TLS 1.0 / 1.1的支持，以帮助提高Web平台的总体安全级别。这对于推动TLS生态系统向前发展以及消除由TLS 1.0 / 1.1造成的许多漏洞至关重要，TLS 1.0 / 1.1并没有我们想像的那样健壮，急需隐退。 Mozilla、Google、Microsoft和Apple于2018年10月首次共同倡议对其进行修改。如今到了2020年3月，我们都兑现了诺言（Apple除外，Apple将稍晚些时候做出更改）。 其结果是要确保您的Web服务器支持TLS 1.2或1.3以上。请阅读有关移除TLS 1.0和1.1的更新说明，以了解如何测试和更新TLS/SSL配置。从现在开始，连接到使用旧版本TLS的服务器时，Firefox将返回安全连接失败（Secure Connection Failed）错误。如果尚未升级，请立即升级！ 注意:在未来几个发布周期（对于Firefox的延长支持版本来说，发布周期会更长），安全连接失败（Secure […]

titulo: Securing Firefox with WebAssembly
resumen: Protecting the security and privacy of individuals is a central tenet of Mozilla’s mission. While we continue to make extensive use of both sandboxing and Rust in Firefox to address security challenges in the browser, each has its limitations. Today we’re adding a third approach to our arsenal. RLBox, a new sandboxing technology developed by researchers at the University of California, San Diego, and the University of Texas, Austin, allows us to quickly and efficiently convert existing Firefox components to run inside a WebAssembly sandbox.

titulo: It’s the Boot for TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1
resumen: The Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol is the de facto means for establishing security on the Web. The newest version, TLS 1.3, improves efficiency and remedies the flaws and weaknesses present in earlier versions. In October 2018, we announced our plans regarding TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 deprecation. Now's the time for us to make this change together and move the TLS ecosystem forward.

titulo: Using WebAssembly from .NET with Wasmtime
resumen: Wasmtime, the WebAssembly runtime from the Bytecode Alliance, recently added an early preview of an API for .NET Core, Microsoft’s free, open-source, and cross-platform application runtime. This API enables developers to programmatically load and execute WebAssembly code directly from .NET programs. Although .NET Core is already a cross-platform runtime, there are good reasons for .NET developers to take a closer look at WebAssembly, as Peter Huene demonstrates in this post.

resumen: Earlier this year we decided to reduce the amount of unsolicited notification permission prompts people receive as they move around the web using the Firefox browser. This is an intrinsic part of Mozilla's commitment to putting people first when they are online. In preparation, we ran a series of studies and experiments to understand how to improve the user experience and reduce annoyance. Now we're making some changes to the workflow for how sites ask users for permission to send them notifications.

titulo: The two-value syntax of the CSS Display property
resumen: The display CSS property is how we change the formatting context of an element and its children. One of the first things you will learn about CSS is that some elements are block by default, and others are inline. The display property enables switching between these states. With support currently available only in Firefox 70, it is too early to start using these two-value properties in production. However, they are important to be aware of, in terms of what they mean for CSS.

titulo: Faster Layouts with CSS Grid (and Subgrid!)
resumen: CSS Grid has been available in most major browsers since early 2017, and it makes web layout more powerful than ever before. But complex-looking new syntax (line-names! grid-areas! minmax! fit-content! fr units!) and missing IE11 support can make it scary. Don’t let that stop you. Miriam Suzanne offers some basic approaches you can put to work today.

titulo: Why is CSS So Weird?
resumen: CSS is the design language of the web — one of three core web languages — but it also seems to be the most contentious and often perplexing. It's too easy and too hard, too fragile and too resilient. Love it or hate it, CSS is weird: not quite markup, not quite programming in the common (imperative) sense, and nothing like the design programs we use for print. How did we get here?

titulo: WebHint in Firefox DevTools: Improve Compatibility, Accessibility and more
resumen: Creating experiences that look and work great across different browsers is one of the biggest challenges on the web. It can also be the most rewarding part, as it gets your app to as many users as possible. Testing legacy browsers late in the development process can break a feature that you spent hours on, even requiring rewrites to fix. What if the tools in your primary development browser could warn you sooner? With Webhint in Firefox DevTools, we can do exactly that, and more.

titulo: Moving Firefox to a faster 4-week release cycle
resumen: Building and releasing a browser is complicated and involves many players. To optimize the process, and make it more reliable for all users, over the years we’ve developed a phased release strategy that includes ‘pre-release’ channels: Firefox Nightly, Beta, and Developer Edition. Starting Q1 2020, we're making a change. We plan to start shipping a major Firefox release every 4 weeks!

titulo: Debugging WebAssembly Outside of the Browser
resumen: WebAssembly has begun to establish itself outside of the browser via dedicated runtimes like Mozilla’s Wasmtime and Fastly’s Lucet. While the promise of a new, universal format for programs is appealing, it also comes with new challenges. At Mozilla, we’ve been prototyping ways to enable source-level debugging of .wasm files using existing tools, like GDB and LLDB.

titulo: The Baseline Interpreter: a faster JS interpreter in Firefox 70
resumen: Modern web applications load and execute a lot more JavaScript code than they did just a few years ago. While JIT (just-in-time) compilers have been very successful in making JavaScript performant, we needed a better solution. We’ve added a new, generated JavaScript bytecode interpreter to the JavaScript engine in Firefox 70. Instead of writing a new interpreter from scratch, we found a way to do this by sharing most code with our existing Baseline JIT. Meet the new Baseline Interpreter.

titulo: Standardizing WASI: A system interface to run WebAssembly outside the web
resumen: WebAssembly is an assembly language for a conceptual machine, not a physical one. This is why it can be run across a variety of different machine architectures. WebAssembly needs a system interface for a conceptual operating system, not any single operating system. This way, it can be run across all different OSs. WASI is  a system interface for the WebAssembly platform that will be a true companion to WebAssembly and uphold the key principles of portability and security.

titulo: Implications of Rewriting a Browser Component in Rust
resumen: There have been 69 security bugs in Firefox’s style component since the browser was first released in 2002. If we'd had a time machine and could have written this component in Rust from the start, 51 (73.9%) of these bugs would not have been possible. Rust isn't foolproof, but by removing the burden of memory safety, Rust lets programmers focus on logical correctness and soundness.

titulo: Firefox 66 to block automatically playing audible video and audio
resumen: Unsolicited volume can be a great source of distraction and frustration for users of the web. So we are making changes to how Firefox handles playing media with sound and we want to make sure web developers are aware of this new audio autoplay blocking default. With the release of Firefox 66, now in Firefox Beta/Developer Edition, the browser will block audible audio and video, and will allow a site to play audio or video aloud via the HTMLMediaElement API only once the user has initiated the audio.

titulo: Rust 2018 is here… but what is it?
resumen: Starting today, the Rust 2018 edition is in its first release. With this edition, we’ve focused on making Rust developers as productive as they can be. Most of the language changes are completely compatible with existing Rust code. Because they don’t break any code, they also work in any Rust code… even if that code doesn’t use Rust 2018. This is because of the way the language is evolving. Lin Clark illustrates and explains.

titulo: Calls between JavaScript and WebAssembly are finally fast 🎉
resumen: At Mozilla, we want WebAssembly to be as fast as it can be. This started with its design, which gives it great throughput. Then we improved load times with a streaming baseline compiler. With this, we compile code faster than it comes over the network. Now, in the latest version of Firefox Beta, calls between JS and WebAssembly are faster than many JS to JS function calls. Here's how we made them fast - illustrated in code cartoons.

titulo: Hack on MDN: Better accessibility for MDN Web Docs
resumen: Making websites accessible to a wide range of users is a vital topic for creators on the web. Over a long weekend in late September, more than twenty people met in London to work on accessibility on the MDN Web Docs website — both the content about accessibility and the accessibility of the site itself. The result was a considerable refresh and new opportunities to continue the projects begun.

titulo: Dweb: Building Cooperation and Trust into the Web with IPFS
resumen: The Interplanetary File System (IPFS) is a new protocol powered by individuals on the internet. Its goal is to “re-decentralize” the web by replacing location-oriented HTTP with a content-oriented protocol that allows websites and web apps to be “served” by any computer on the internet with IPFS support. IPFS and the distributed web decouple information from physical location and singular distribution, with the aim of creating a more affordable, available, and faster web for all.

titulo: Dweb: Serving the Web from the Browser with Beaker
resumen: Publishing and sharing is core to the Web’s ethos, yet to publish your own website or even just share a document, you need to know how to run a server, or be able to pay someone to do it for you. Peer-to-peer protocols like dat:// make it possible for regular user devices to host content, so Beaker uses dat:// to enable publishing from the browser, where instead of using a server, a website’s author and its visitors help host its files. It’s kind of like BitTorrent, but for websites!

titulo: Dweb: Building a Resilient Web with WebTorrent
resumen: The web is healthy when the financial cost of self-expression isn’t a barrier. This installment of the Dweb series describes WebTorrent – an implementation of the BitTorrent protocol that runs in a web browser. It’s written completely in JavaScript – the language of the web – and uses WebRTC for true peer-to-peer transport. No browser plugin, extension, or installation is required. The distributed approach removes the cost of running centralized servers at data centers, allowing websites to scale sustainably.

titulo: Dark Theme Darkening: Better Theming for Firefox Quantum
resumen: A team of computer science students from Michigan State University's capstone program went to work on Firefox Quantum’s Theming API. Their goal: Expand upon the existing “lightweight” Theming API in Quantum to allow for more areas of customization. Themes had the ability to alter the appearance of the default toolbars, but did not have the ability to style menus, or customize auto-complete popups -- till now. The team also worked on adding a more fluid transition when dynamic themes change, to allow for a smoother user experience.

titulo: Retained Display Lists for improved page performance
resumen: Display list building is the process in which we collect the set of high-level items to display on screen (borders, backgrounds, text and much more), and then sort the list, according to CSS painting rules, into the correct back-to-front order. By retaining the display list and only reloading the assets that have changed since first paint, we are able to optimize painting performance especially for highly interactive pages. Look for this feature in this week's release of Firefox 61.

titulo: Build your own web things with the Things Framework
resumen: Last year Mozilla started Project Things to help developers connect physical “things” to the web in a safe, secure and interoperable way. Now, with the 0.4 release of the Things Gateway, you can add native web things to your gateway, to control them alongside all your other smart home devices. The advantage of native web things is that they don’t need a custom gateway adapter because they follow a common standard using existing web technologies.

titulo: Sneak Peek at WebAssembly Studio
resumen: WebAssembly.Studio is an online IDE (integrated development environment) that helps you learn and teach others. It’s also a Swiss Army knife that comes in handy whenever working with WebAssembly (WASM). WebAssembly is a low-level assembly-like language that runs with near-native performance and provides languages such as C/C++/Rust with a compilation target so that they can run on the web. WASM is also designed to run alongside JavaScript.

titulo: JavaScript to Rust and Back Again: A wasm-bindgen Tale
resumen: Recently we’ve seen how WebAssembly is incredibly fast to compile, speeding up JS libraries, and generating even smaller binaries. We’ve even got a high-level plan for better interoperability between the Rust and JavaScript communities, as well as other web programming languages. The goal of wasm-bindgen is to provide a bridge between the types of JavaScript and Rust. It allows JS to call a Rust API with a string, or a Rust function to catch a JS exception. wasm-bindgen erases the impedance mismatch between WebAssembly and JavaScript, ensuring that JavaScript can invoke WebAssembly functions efficiently and without boilerplate, and that WebAssembly can do the same with JavaScript functions.

titulo: MDN browser compatibility data: Taking the guesswork out of web compatibility
resumen: The most powerful aspect of the web is also what makes it so challenging to build for: its universality. When you create a website, you’re writing code that needs to be understood by a plethora of browsers on different devices and operating systems. To allow for browser compatibility data to be accessed programmatically rather than requiring developers to manually search for it, the MDN community is working on migrating the compatibility information currently stored on thousands of wiki pages to a machine-readable JSON format in a GitHub repository.

titulo: A rule-based framework to create dynamic themes
resumen: One issue with dynamic theming API compared to traditional CSS theming is that it requires familiarity with JavaScript and WebExtension APIs to make a basic dynamic theme. To address this problem, I have experimented with a simple system that enables dynamic theming using simple theming “rules”. A “rule” consists of a JavaScript condition string paired with a theme name. The boilerplate I've built takes care of the heavy-lifting needed by dynamic themes in order to set up WebExtension listeners, hooking with other APIs — to let you focus on the dynamic theming part.

titulo: Oxidizing Source Maps with Rust and WebAssembly
resumen: A detailed look at how we replaced the most performance-sensitive portions of the source-map JavaScript Library’s source map parser with Rust code that is compiled to WebAssembly. The results: The WebAssembly is up to 5.89 times faster than the JavaScript implementation on realistic benchmarks operating on real world source maps! Additionally, performance is also more consistent: relative standard deviations decreased. We hope that, by sharing our experience, we inspire others rewrite performance-sensitive JavaScript in Rust via WebAssembly.

titulo: Making WebAssembly even faster: Firefox’s new streaming and tiering compiler
resumen: People call WebAssembly a game changer because it makes it possible to run code on the web faster. Some speedups are already present, and some are yet to come. With streaming compilation, the browser compiles the code while the code is still being downloaded. Up until now, this was just a potential future speedup. But with the release of Firefox 58 next week, it becomes a reality. Firefox 58 also includes a new 2-tiered compiler. The new baseline compiler compiles code 10–15 times faster than the optimizing compiler. Combined, these two changes mean we compile code faster than it comes in from the network.

titulo: Using Hardware Token-based 2FA with the WebAuthn API
resumen: To provide higher security for logins, websites are deploying two-factor authentication (2FA), often using a smartphone application or text messages. Those mechanisms make phishing harder but fail to prevent it entirely. Firefox 60 will ship with the WebAuthn API enabled by default, providing two-factor authentication built on public-key cryptography immune to phishing as we know it today. The API is available today in Firefox Nightly, and it's not too soon to start learning how to secure millions of users already in possession of FIDO U2F USB tokens.

titulo: DASH playback of AV1 video in Firefox
resumen: Bitmovin and Mozilla, both members of the Alliance for Open Media (AOM), are partnering to bring AV1 playback with HTML5 to Firefox as the first browser to play AV1 MPEG-DASH/HLS streams. To make playback possible while the AV1 bitstream is still being finalized, we just need to ensure that the encoder and decoder use the same version of the bitstream. Bitmovin and Mozilla agreed on a simple, but for the time being useful, codec string, to ensure compatibility - check out the playback demo to see for yourself.

titulo: Go beyond console.log with the Firefox Debugger
resumen: console.log is no debugger. It’s great for figuring out what your JavaScript app is up to, but it’s limited to spitting out a minimal amount of information. If your code is complex, you’ll need a proper debugger. That’s why we’ve added a new section to the Firefox Devtools Playground that’s all about debugging, with four basic lessons that use the Firefox Debugger to examine and repair a simple JavaScript to-do app.

resumen: Asynchronous pan and zoom (APZ) is landing in Firefox Quantum, which means jank-free, smooth scrolling for all! Until now, scrolling was part of the main JavaScript thread. This meant that when JavaScript code was being executed, the user could not scroll the page. With APZ, scrolling is decoupled from the JavaScript thread, leading to a smoother scrolling experience, especially in slower devices, like mobile phones.

titulo: Using Immutable Caching To Speed Up The Web
resumen: The benefits of immutable caching mean that when a page is refreshed, which is an extremely common social media scenario, elements that were previously marked immutable with an HTTP response header do not have to be revalidated with the server. Lacking this hint, the browser needs to guess which objects may or may not change on reload - wasting time on one hand or risking website incompatibility on the other.

titulo: CSS Grid and Grid Highlighter Now in Firefox Developer Edition
resumen: CSS Grid has just been uplifted to Firefox 52 Developer Edition. With Chrome (and hopefully Safari and Edge) implementations coming shortly, using grid to build websites will soon be possible in release browsers across the board. Grid allows users to decouple HTML from layout concerns, expressing those concerns exclusively in CSS. Reducing the risks of fragility, code bloat, and high maintenance costs inherent in how we currently build on the web, grid really does have the potential to change the way we do layouts.

titulo: stylish text with text-shadow
